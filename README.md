# paging-library-testdrive
A simple example of the android paging library. This project is meant to accompany the blog post at:
https://blog.bltucker.com/an-updated-look-at-the-paging-library/

The android-client folder contains a small android project that shows an example of each of the 3
DataSource objects implemented by the paging library.

The sample-api folder contains a small sample api that the app works with for its 
ItemKeyedDataSource and PageKeyedDataSource. The PositionalDataSource requires that you have an
api key with http://www.football-data.org/.
